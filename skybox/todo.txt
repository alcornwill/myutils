probably use cycles (unfortunately) or find some way using bake (mirror?)
reason is because we need border on rendered environment map

tidy script, maybe put into blender utils file, maybe make command line version
make so doesn't even export .egg, panda3d should use setTexture
(script to auto render lots of equitangular images into environment maps?)
